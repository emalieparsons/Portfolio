  		<p><i>To be a writer you must be confident, you must be effective, and above all you must be a communicator.</i></p>
  		<p>I am a professional writer and I cannot deny my passion to succeed. I have always been a hard-worker, with my eyes ever set on my promising future. I am someone who believes that anything is possible with perseverance and the right mind set. I love to be involved in several different things at once whether itâ€™s training for a half marathon, volunteering at the Humane Society, or planning the next surprise party for a friend. In my free time, you will find me curled up with a steaming cup of green tea and a good book. </p>
