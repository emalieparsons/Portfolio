    <h3>Poster</h3>
    <p>In this example, I created a poster that would advertise an event that I am very passionate for. Every year, participants run dressed in elephants costumes to help the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust better protect wild herds and their orphaned infant young. All proceeds are donated to incredible organization.</p>

The specific example is the intermediate insert I created for users who had already mastered the beginner training manual, and would like to explore more advanced possibilites when editing.</p>
