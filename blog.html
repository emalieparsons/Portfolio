  	<h3> All Small Things </h3> 
  	</div>
  		<p>Life is about the small things, whether it is small actions of kindness or inspiring quotes stumbled upon. Nevertheless, these artifacts have a purpose whether it is a monumental revelation, or simply something to smile about and cherish.</p>
  		<p>I began collecting quotes in a small book, and in no time the pages were covered with sentences that had a big enough impact on me that I never wanted to forget them. The worn yellow cover of the book boldly reads CREATE. every day. That is what I intend to do.</p>

  	<h3> Growth is never by mere chance; it is the result of forces working together</h3>
  	</div>
 		 <p>You walk around Detroit and see nurses in bright colored scrubs walking to get lunch. Doctors swiftly walk past you on the sidewalk, a quick cup of coffee in mind before they are due back at the DMC. You see businessmen talking on their cell phones, their blazer moving with the hot Michigan heat. Range rovers, mustangs, and BMWs fly by in a flash of black, blue, and white as the shimmering GM cylindrical towers stretch towards the sky in the background. And in the foreground the landscape is filled with the vibrant green of sprawling trees and the happy yellow of tulips swaying in the breeze. Students from Wayne State University in skinny jeans and bohemian scarves walk past you, on their way to Great Lakes for some good coffee and a place to type away on their laptops for hours. You follow and upon arrival, the barista gives you a warm smile and the soothing smell of coffee beans puts you at ease. You grab your mocha peppermint roast and continue walking down Woodward until you are at the heart of the city, the roundabout downtown with the sleek silver restaurants and the skyscrapers that house thousands of young workers striving to put Detroit back on the map. Here houses Campus Martius, Comerica Park, Ford Field, the DIA, The Detroit Opera House, and the Masonic Temple to name a few. On every vacated building you will find natural pieces of artwork: graffiti tattooing a cultural city that has a history of scars, stories, and a lot of room to grow.</p>
 		 <p>You stand on the corner of this bustling city and gaze at the magnificent architecture of each building. Here in Detroit, every structure is original, wise from years of social, political, and economic rise and fall, and the millions of people that have passed through its historic streets. You shake your head as you remark upon the warnings you had received: murderers on every street, burnt down buildings upon the brink of collapsing, a city vacant and devoid of life and growth. No, Detroit is nothing like you had imagined.</p>
 		 <p>Growth is never by mere chance; it is the result of forces working together.</p>
