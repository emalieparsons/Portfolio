  	<h3> All Small Things </h3> 
  		<p>Life is about the small things, whether it is small actions of kindness or inspiring quotes stumbled upon. Nevertheless, these artifacts have a purpose whether it is a monumental revelation, or simply something to smile about and cherish.</p>
  		<p>I began collecting quotes in a small book, and in no time the pages were covered with sentences that had a big enough impact on me that I never wanted to forget them. The worn yellow cover of the book boldly reads CREATE. every day. That is what I intend to do.</p>

  	<h3> Growth is never by mere chance; it is the result of forces working together</h3>
 		 <p>You walk around Detroit and see nurses in bright colored scrubs walking to get lunch. Doctors swiftly walk past you on the sidewalk, a quick cup of coffee in mind before they are due back at the DMC. You see businessmen talking on their cell phones, their blazer moving with the hot Michigan heat. Range rovers, mustangs, and BMWs fly by in a flash of black, blue, and white as the shimmering GM cylindrical towers stretch towards the sky in the background. And in the foreground the landscape is filled with the vibrant green of sprawling trees and the happy yellow of tulips swaying in the breeze. Students from Wayne State University in skinny jeans and bohemian scarves walk past you, on their way to Great Lakes for some good coffee and a place to type away on their laptops for hours. You follow and upon arrival, the barista gives you a warm smile and the soothing smell of coffee beans puts you at ease. You grab your mocha peppermint roast and continue walking down Woodward until you are at the heart of the city, the roundabout downtown with the sleek silver restaurants and the skyscrapers that house thousands of young workers striving to put Detroit back on the map. Here houses Campus Martius, Comerica Park, Ford Field, the DIA, The Detroit Opera House, and the Masonic Temple to name a few. On every vacated building you will find natural pieces of artwork: graffiti tattooing a cultural city that has a history of scars, stories, and a lot of room to grow.</p>
 		 <p>You stand on the corner of this bustling city and gaze at the magnificent architecture of each building. Here in Detroit, every structure is original, wise from years of social, political, and economic rise and fall, and the millions of people that have passed through its historic streets. You shake your head as you remark upon the warnings you had received: murderers on every street, burnt down buildings upon the brink of collapsing, a city vacant and devoid of life and growth. No, Detroit is nothing like you had imagined.</p>
 		 <p>Growth is never by mere chance; it is the result of forces working together.</p>

  	<h3> The Essence of Inhumanity </h3>
  		<p>I was driving home from a doctor’s appointment last summer when I hit a long backup of cars, bumper to bumper, taillights and headlights flirting. The telltale signs of an accident. Finally approaching the wreck, I discovered it had happened only moments before, the police cars not yet present. A small silver car was haggardly splayed in the middle of the road with the whole front of the car folded like an accordion. As I stared at the scene, I noticed a woman who had seen the accident running towards the car. Turning around in my seat to witness the event, I watched the woman fling open the smashed car door where a young man was unconscious and bloodied. To my amazement, the woman who had no idea who this teenager was, whipped off her clean white shirt and began to press it to his wounds. Standing in a tank top in the middle of this busy road, the woman was thinking of anyone but herself.</p>
  		<p>This scene will be forever imprinted upon my mind. I cannot forget the compassion and selflessness I witnessed that day. It is moments like this that I find true pride in the human race as we coexist, and live for one another.</p>
  		<p>Last week I was walking back to my dorm room when a homeless woman sitting at a bus stop asked me for some spare change. With a shy shake of my head, I continued walking as I attempted to shake off my guilt. The guilt that this woman who had nothing was asking for only a few coins that I knew I had in my backpack.</p>
  		<p>Sitting here, I am ashamed at my lack of compassion for this old woman. I was completely indifferent to her desperation and thought only of myself. I think of the woman who tore the shirt of her back for someone in need, whereas I could not even reach into my pocket to give a few coins to a woman who lived on the streets and didn’t know where she’d get her next meal.</p>
  		<p>The worst sin towards our fellow creatures is not to hate them, but to be indifferent to them; that’s the essence of inhumanity. </p>
  		<p>We will all have opportunities in life where someone will need us, and for a little while we will have to disregard ourselves. No longer can life be viewed as my world, the place where I am the focal point. Rather, see life as it is: the place where billions of people and creatures live together, and for each other.</p>

  	<h3> Have fun with it</h3>
  		<p>On the eve of finals week, during the last class before my final paper was due, my professor told my class to  “Have fun with it.” Looking at Shakespeare’s Sonnet 71 in addition to my four notebook pages filled with notes, I shook my head and laughed at the remark. How can I have fun with this impossible sonnet knowing that my 4.0 depends on it. After rewriting three new thesis statements, I was having everything and anything but fun.</p>
		<p>However, as I begin the finals crunch I keep coming back to that phrase. Have fun with it.</p>
		<p>When did learning become a burden?</p>
		<p>Why do I hate Spanish so much? A few years ago a friend enlightened me with this: “I don’t look at Spanish as a grade or a requirement. I see it as an opportunity to learn a new language and learn about a different part of the world. ” I constantly make fun of my required ISS class (Integrative Social Sciences) and call it my “Indian class.” However, in this class I study anthropology and have gained a better understanding of not only Native Americans and their evolution with the advancing outside world, but I have learned about cultural practices from around the world. In my Intro to Fiction Writing class I was disappointed that I learned less about writing and more about racism. Now though, my stories have a deeper level that includes race, class, and gender.</p>
		<p>As finals approach I drag my feet and constantly complain as I sip my mediocre cafeteria coffee.</p>
		<p>What I should be doing instead is reflecting on the first year of college education I have completed, and how much I have already learned. I should be excited to apply my literary analysis techniques to one of the greatest writers of all time. I should be excited to complete my portfolio of fiction stories where I explore a new world of race and gender. I should be excited that I still have one more semester of Spanish to further learn the language and culture.</p>
		<p>Although you may not relate to my specific courses, you can (hopefully) acknowledge the value of knowledge. As illustrated in the title of this blog, life is about all the small things. Maybe you had to wake up early for an 8 a.m. but at least you learned something new about the world today. Appreciate it.</p>

  <div id="success">
  	<h3>To be successful, you have to be the best</h3>
  		<p>To be successful, you have to be the best.</p>
		<p>Take this standard and throw it out with window with as much force and hatred you can muster. If you live by this motto, you are setting yourself up for failure because you are never going to be the best.</p>
		<p>Wellesley High School graduates received the absolute best advice on their graduation day when English teacher David McCullough, Jr. told them “you are not special.” Entering the real world, or fabricated college version of the real world, “think about this: even if you’re one in a million, on a planet of 6.8 billion that means there are nearly 7,000 people just like you.”</p> 
		<p>Don’t live your life thinking you have to be the best. Don’t even live your life with the sole motivation of success. Pressure from parents, teachers, peers, and the media make you believe that you have to be the top of your profession, earning obscene amounts of money, living only to be successful.</p>
		<p>If there are 7,000 people just like you, what makes you different?</p>
		<p>Drive. Drive is what sets you apart from the thousands of young applicants who are smarter and have more experience. Walk into an interview with your shoulders back and head high knowing that you want this position the most, and you are going to work the hardest for it.</p>
		<p>Success isn’t having frequent panic attacks, losing sleep at night, and always worrying that you are going nowhere. Success is recognizing where you need improvement, pursuing what you love with an unwavering confidence, and most importantly remembering that happiness comes first.</p>

  	<h3> I am still learning </h3>
  		<p>Michelangelo created some of the most beautiful and inspiring sculptures and paintings in art history. He resurrected the classical contrapposto style employed in the Roman era in the sculpture of David. He exceeded the Renaissance emotional expression in his sculpted Pieta. He spent four years painting well over 5,000 frescos on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. And yet, as quoted by the accomplished artist, “I am still learning.”</p>
		<p>Feeling utterly insignificant as I sit in my dorm room in sweatpants, typing on my laptop and avoiding homework I am comforted by the long dead artistic genius. I will not belittle Michelangelo of course, but we are the same. It doesn’t matter how many commissions we receive, articles we write, or how impressive our portfolios are. There will always be things to learn, even if we are a master at our craft. Albert Einstein spent years developing the Theory of Relativity and retired countless equations before he finally developed the right one.</p>
		<p>I will spend years writing. I will be rejected by countless publishers. But I will keep working at it until I paint a ceiling or create an equation to explain how speed has an effect on physics (a grossly simplified definition).</p>

  	<h3>Let Go</h3>
  		<p>“One of the happiest moments ever, is when you find the courage to let go of what you can’t change.”</p>
		<p>This week I have learned to let go.</p>
		<p>With an unparalleled stubbornness, I have desperately clung to the conventions of my past. For so long, I refused to contend that much had changed, and was terrified that the possibility of change would forever hold a negative connotation in my life. However, I have accepted that girls exist in Miami.</p>
		<p>You may be shaking your head and laughing at the ridiculous obviousness of the statement, but that is how successful I am at lying to myself. I am currently functioning in a long distant relationship, the heart lines reaching from East Lansing, MI to Miami, Fl. It has been a year now that we have coexisted in our separate universes but the concept of other females in my significant other’s life was obsolete until now. In the past whenever he had mentioned other girls I would simply shut down and build a protective barrier around myself to block out the painful thought of someone else getting to spend time with him. Over time, this conditioned him to cease relaying opposite gender accounts and allowed me to create this fantasy world where only the “bros” hung out.</p>
		<p>I will not share the gory details of my eventual enlightenment, but I can confidently say that I can scroll through Facebook and see him tagged in pictures with girls and feel not even a hint of sadness, anger, or jealousy.</p>
		<p>The moral of this embarrassing story is to accept change. As stated in the quote of the week, accepting change will be the happiest and most beneficial decision you can make. Running from your fears or simply denying their existence is letting those anxieties hinder your ability to accept and move on. With first hand experience, I implore you to face change head on and deal with the pain or unease with an unwavering strength.</p>
		<p>Define the change taking place. Come to terms with why that change instills unease. Let go.</p>

  <div id="naked">
  	<h3> To be naked is to be speechless</h3>
  		<p>As a writer, I wear my thoughts and feelings like they are stamped on my very clothing. As words coalesce into poetry and meaning they knit into one snug sweater I wear to keep out the cold. With each determined step, my words beat against the ground and guide my path. To be completely naked in public is to have nothing to say, no brooding thought or breathtaking quote to meticulously break down into meaning and symbology.</p>
		<p>Writers do not simply write arbitrary letters that fall into nothingness. They delicately weave the language into their skin, words tattooing every inch of their bodies.</p>
